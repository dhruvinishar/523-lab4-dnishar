I have decided to hop on the 'Bitmoji' trend that MDS seems to follow XD

## Slides with R code

```{r cars, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

economist_scatter <- function(data, x, y, colour_by) {
    ggplot(data, aes(x = {{ x }}, y = {{ y }})) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 2, aes(color = {{ colour_by }})) +
    ggtitle("This is a sample plot from the penguins data") +
    theme_economist()
}
economist_scatter(penguins, body_mass_g, flipper_length_mm, sex)

```

## Another Text Slide

Let's talk more about the penguins data from the `palmerpenguins` library.

The goal of palmerpenguins is to provide a great dataset for data exploration & visualization, as an alternative to `iris`. Data were collected and made available by [Dr.Â Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/). The palmerpenguins package contains two datasets.

You can find more information [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

## Exploring the data

```{r Exploration, echo=TRUE}
print("The columns in this data are:")
print(names(penguins))
```

## More visualization
```{r Graph, fig.height=5, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
penguins %>%
  count(species) %>%
  ggplot() + geom_col(aes(x = species, y = n, fill = species)) +
  geom_label(aes(x = species, y = n, label = n)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = 'Penguins Species & Count')
```
